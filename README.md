# Elemental Conquest: Territory Wars

**Master the elements. Claim territory. Conquer the realm.**

## The Game

Elemental Conquest combines the simplicity of mobile puzzle games with the strategic depth of territory control. Players draw lines to claim territory, then command elemental armies to expand their dominion.

### Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Claim Territory** - Draw lines to complete squares and claim them for your element
2. **Command Armies** - Move your forces to attack enemy territories or reinforce your own
3. **Achieve Dominance** - Control 60% of the map to achieve elemental victory

### Elements
- ðŸ”¥ **Fire** - Aggressive and fast
- ðŸ’§ **Water** - Fluid and adaptive  
- ðŸŒ± **Earth** - Strong and defensive
- ðŸ’¨ **Wind** - Swift and mobile

## Market Position

Targets the same casual-competitive space that Clash Royale and Territory.io occupyâ€”but with a stronger visual identity and elemental asymmetry.

## Vision

Players master one element, but to dominate the world, they must learn them all.
