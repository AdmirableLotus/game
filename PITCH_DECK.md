# ELEMENTAL CONQUEST — Investor One-Pager

**Tagline:** Claim territory. Command your element. Conquer the world.

## 🌍 Concept

Elemental Conquest is a fast, turn-based strategy game that fuses the elegance of Dots & Boxes with the tactical weight of territory control.

Players harness one of four primal forces — **Fire**, **Water**, **Earth**, or **Wind** — to draw borders, summon armies, and outmaneuver rivals across dynamic maps.

### Each element has unique perks:

- **🔥 Fire** spreads through conquered lines, consuming nearby neutral tiles
- **💧 Water** fortifies captured territory, slowing enemy advance  
- **🌱 Earth** regenerates lost ground over time
- **💨 Wind** moves armies farther and reacts faster to enemy turns

**Matches last 10–15 minutes:** quick to learn, hard to master.

## ⚙️ Technology

- **Frontend:** React Native (TypeScript), styled for mobile and PC
- **Backend:** FastAPI with MongoDB  
- **Multiplayer:** Real-time room-code architecture (WebSocket integration planned)
- **Cross-platform:** Built once, runs on Web, PC, and Mobile

This stack keeps dev costs low and expansion easy.

## 🧩 Market Fit

- **Audience:** midcore players aged 18–35 who enjoy tactical depth without 4X grind
- **Inspiration Space:** Clash Royale, Territory.io, Advance Wars
- **Monetization:** cosmetic upgrades, elemental skins, ranked play, optional seasonal pass
- **Launch Path:** itch.io + Steam Early Access → Mobile cross-release

## 📈 Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Next 60 Days):
- ✅ Finalize army movement and victory logic
- ✅ Add sound, animation, win/lose transitions  
- ✅ Build PC-ready demo for Steam/itch.io

### Phase 2 (Q2 Release):
- Implement online multiplayer
- Add ranked matchmaking and elemental balancing

### Phase 3 (Q3 Expansion):
- Story campaign, unlockable elements, team modes

## 💡 Vision

Elemental Conquest reimagines classic territory mechanics through a modern, tactile interface.

**Our goal:** to create a strategy game that's both visually elegant and emotionally kinetic — a digital board game that feels alive.
